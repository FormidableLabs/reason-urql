# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2019-09-26

This release removes `bs-fetch` as a dependency such that it doesn't conflict with a user's local copy of `bs-fetch`. Since we only use `bs-fetch` for type checking `fetchOptions`, it can safely be included as a `devDependency`. This release also adds a `message` field on the `combinedError` record to provide users access to the raw error string from `urql`.

### Removed

- Dependency on `bs-fetch`. `bs-fetch` is now a `devDependency` for `reason-urql` and can also be installed as a `peerDependency` if you want to use a different version in your app. PR by @parkerziegler and @gugahoa [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/reason-urql/pull/104).

### Added

- `message` field on `CombinedError.combinedError`. This represents the raw string `message` returned by the `urql` client for your requests. PR by @Schmavery [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/reason-urql/pull/105).

## [1.0.0] - 2019-09-18

This release represents the first stable reason of `reason-urql`. From this point forward we'll be starting to enforce semantic versioning for all changes. Thank you so much to all of the contributors who helped us to achieve this milestone!

### Added

- A [Getting Started](./docs/getting_started.md) guide to help first time users of `reason-urql` get up and running.

### Changed

- The `Error(e)` constructor of the `response` variant has been moved above the `Data(d)` constructor to better match `urql`'s JS API, where uses check for error responses on the GraphQL request before operating on data.
- The `Types` and `Client.Types` `module`s were renamed to `UrqlTypes` and `Client.ClientTypes` to avoid namespace collisions with user-defined `Types` `module`s.

## [1.0.0-beta.3] â€“ Type Inference on Client.execute\* Methods - 2019-08-17

This release adds improved type inference around the `Client`'s `execute*` methods (i.e. `executeQuery`, `executeMutation`, and `executeSubscription`). Responses will now be fully type checked at compile time. This release also pins the bound version of `urql` to 1.0.5 to address a regression that occurs when using `urql` > 1.2.0.

### Changed

- Add proper type inference to `Client.execute*` methods. This now involves passing the full `graphql_ppx` module to the `Client` such that it can grab the `parse` method off of it to properly infer the response. This mimics exactly how the components and hooks work.
- Reorganize types to reduce redundancy and ensure unique generation of `[@bs.deriving abstract]` accessors. This change is mostly internal, but it begins to isolated types used by different `module`s into submodules. For example, rather than all types living in the top-level `Types` module, certain types reserved for particular domains, i.e. the `Client`, live in a submodule i.e. `Client.Types`.

## [1.0.0-beta.2] â€“ CombinedError and FetchOption Function - 2019-07-22

This release adds small improvements around `client.fetchOptions` and the `CombinedError` API.

### Changed

- The `FetchFn` variant of the client's `fetchOptions` argument now supports calling the function at runtime of the client rather than invoking it early in order to pass a `fetchOptions` object to `urql`.
- `UrqlCombinedError` is now properly bound using OCaml classes. A helper was added to convert the `CombinedError` `Js.t` to a record type to allow for nicer, typesafe access.

## [1.0.0-beta.1] â€“ ðŸŽ£ Hooks - 2019-07-06

This release includes support for `urql` hooks, including `useQuery`, `useMutation`, and `useSubscription`. It also includes additions to support proper type inference of GraphQL requests, such that users get compile-time guarantees that they are accessing data in a fully type-safe way.

### Added

- Bindings for `useQuery`, `useMutation`, and `useSubscription`.
- Bindings for `SubscriptionWithHandler`, which is to be used in cases where a custom `handler` function is passed to the `Subscription` component to accumulate subscriptions.
- The top-level `urql` context object, which exposes a `Consumer` and `Provider`, is now exposed to the user.

### Changed

- Migrated all components and examples to latest ReasonReact syntax (`"jsx: 3"`).
- Add proper type inference for hooks and components. This is achieved by passing the entire `graphql_ppx` module to the hooks, which allows them to use the `parse` method to infer the return type of data from the request.

## [1.0.0-beta] - ðŸŽ‰ v1 (Beta) - 2019-05-16

This represents the beta release of v1, which provides support for [`urql` v1](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/tree/v1.0.5).

### Added

- Bindings for `Query`, `Mutation`, and `Subscription` components.
- Bindings for `Client` with support for **exchanges**.
- Bindings for `Provider`.
- Bindings for `urql`'s type interfaces, utils, and helpers.
- Examples for `Query`, `Mutation`, `Subscription`, exposed exchanges, custom exchanges, and imperative `Client` methods.
- First tests for `UrqlClient`.

## [0.1.1] - Coverage ðŸ’… - 2019-01-29

### Added

- Additional tests for `Query`, `Mutation`, `Connect`, and `Client`.

### Fixed

- The `invalidate` cache operation supplied to `Connect` now properly accepts a single, optional labelled argument `~query: Query.urqlQuery`. This will now type check properly thanks to a final positional `unit` parameter in the type definition.

## [0.1.0] â€“ We're Stable(ish)! - 2018-12-07

Welcome to v0.1.0 of `reason-urql`. With this release, we are moving into a stable state and will continue onwards with standard [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

### Added

- Unit tests for `UrqlQuery`, `UrqlMutation`, `UrqlConnect`, `UrqlClient`, and `UrqlProvider`.
- Codified utilities for making tests more concise â€“ see `TestUtils.re`.
- Zero-config, hot reloading in the example project.
- Small, non-breaking changes to the API.

## [0.1.0-beta] - GraphQL, meet Reason - 2018-10-07

This is the initial beta release of reason-urql! These bindings are currently untested and should not be used in production just yet. Come help us by writing tests, opening issues, and filing PRs. Thanks!
