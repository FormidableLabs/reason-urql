## [0.1.1] - Coverage ðŸ’… - 2019-01-29

### Added

- Additional tests for `Query`, `Mutation`, `Connect`, and `Client`.

### Fixed

- The `invalidate` cache operation supplied to `Connect` now properly accepts a single, optional labelled argument `~query: Query.urqlQuery`. This will now type check properly thanks to a final positional `unit` parameter in the type definition.
